# I Passed the CISSP Exam 
I passed the CISSP exam on 10th Sept after a year of studying, with just under 110 questions on the exam. I'd love to share my experience, the resources I found valuable, and some tips that might help you on your journey.

I'm simply sharing my experience, not making a recommendation. Everyone has to find their own path forward. ❤️

# Study Plan and Time Management

I didn’t stick to a rigid schedule. Most of my study time was in the evenings after work, on weekends, and during holidays.
My goal was to integrate CISSP prep into my daily routine, even if it was just for a short while. No fancy time management tricks—just steady, incremental progress.

## Resources I Used

### Books:

- ISC2 Official Study Guide (OSG) v9 – My primary study material, though the sheer volume was daunting at times.

- Destination CISSP: A Concise Guide – This was a game-changer due to its straightforward language, which made complex concepts much more accessible.

- ISC2 Official Study Guide (OSG) v8 Simplified Chinese Version - To ensure I clearly understand the Chinese translations of key terms.

### Practice Questions:

- I extensively used the Sybex Official Practice Tests, completing all available sets from V3 and V4.

- The ISC2 learnZapp provided a robust set of practice questions that were a huge help. I purchased a three-month premium subscription.

# Study Techniques

- Active Recall with ANKI: I used ANKI to capture questions I missed and regularly reviewed them, which significantly boosted my retention.

- AI Assistance: For confusing concepts, I used AI tools for instant clarifications and examples, which helped me grasp difficult topics quickly.

- Memory Palace: This technique was invaluable for remembering complex lists and sequences, like Privacy by Design and Security Design Principles.

# Challenges and How I Overcame Them

## Language Barrier
As a non-native English speaker, I struggled with the dense language in the OSG v9 at first. Discovering the more readable Destination CISSP: A Concise Guide made a big difference. I also used a translation feature on a Chinese e-book app (微信读书, a reading app developed by WeChat) for quick translations and content checks—this was a massive time-saver and confidence booster.

## Retention Issues
I found that simply reading wasn’t enough—I kept forgetting details. To combat this, I implemented a spaced repetition schedule using Notion and Google Calendar to systematically review my notes and ANKI cards.

## Mock Exams
I completed 29 full-length practice exams, which were crucial for assessing my readiness and identifying weak areas.
The practice exams often included nuances that weren’t fully covered in the study guides, making them an essential learning tool. 
I’m just sharing my experience, not recommending this approach. Taking 29 practice exams might seem overly cautious, but I wanted to build my confidence with each result, as I needed to be sure I would pass the exam this time.

Here’s the list of exams I completed:

- OSG V9: 4 sets of practice exams

- OSG V10: 4 sets of practice exams

- Official Practice Tests V3: 4 sets of practice exams

- Official Practice Tests V4: 4 sets of practice exams

- isc2 learnZapp: 8 sets of practice exams

- CertPreps: 5 sets of practice exams

How much study time did I spend between practice exams?

It depends, weekly tests 4 months out, twice weekly 1 month before, once weekly final week, but full-time job made sticking to it challenging.
what's more important is , after each practice test, thoroughly review all explanations, focusing on incorrect answers and lucky guesses, and take notes on key concepts.

## Keeping Motivated

It was a long journey with its ups and downs.
For me, the key was “over-preparing.” I studied from October 2023 to September 2024, and although I didn’t study every day, I avoided taking breaks longer than two days.
Engaging with the r/cissp community was also a huge motivator—seeing others’ progress and discovering new resources kept me on track.

# Final Thoughts

Don’t Stick to Just One Resource: I started with the OSG v9, but found it overwhelming. Exploring other materials and finding what suited me best was crucial.

Use What Works for You: Whether it’s ANKI, AI, or a specific YouTube channel, identify and use the tools that align with your learning style.

Stay Updated: The CISSP landscape evolves. Keep an eye on updates and recommendations, especially from active communities like this one.

Reddit was a game-changer for me, with so many tips and encouragement from others in the same boat. I’m paying it forward with my own journey, hoping it’ll make a difference for you too. Best of luck on your CISSP adventure—Keep at it, and you’ll rock it! ✌
