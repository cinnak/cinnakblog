I've read Chip Huyen's [Introduction to Machine Learning Interviews Book](https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/), but not the whole thing since I skipped most of the Part II questions. The book includes so many sincere tips, fabulous learning resource recommendations, and so much real-life experience from Chip herself, her friends, and the people she interviewed.

# Key Takeaways from Chip Huyen's Book

## Understanding the Roles in ML

There are many jobs in the machine learning field, but the ones most relevant to me are ML engineer, software engineer, and data scientist—roles I've been confused about for quite a while. Chip clarifies these differences clearly.

### ML Engineer vs. Software Engineer

It was a bit surprising to learn that hiring managers tend to prefer strong software engineers without much ML knowledge over ML experts. This is because real-world engineering practices are often harder to pick up than ML concepts.

### ML Engineer vs. Data Scientist

Data scientists turn data into business insights, while ML engineers turn data into products. As Chip writes in the book, "_ML engineers definitely need to know ML algorithms, whereas many data scientists can do their jobs without ever touching ML._"

### Knowing Your Optimization Goals

What kind of company should engineers choose? The fundamental principle is to know what you're optimizing for. Although Chip suggests this advice primarily for early-career engineers, I find it practical for anyone at any stage of their career.
Chip breaks down optimization goals into several categories:

- **Money now**: Focusing on short-term financial gain.
- **Money in the future**: Prioritizing long-term earning potential.
- **Impact**: Seeking to make a difference through your work.
- **Experience diversity**: Gaining varied experiences to enhance adaptability.
- **Brand name recognition**: Working for well-known companies to boost your resume.
- **Personal growth**: Focusing on self-improvement and skill development.

Understanding your priorities among these factors will guide your job search and career decisions.

## Interview Preparation Strategies

What companies look for in candidates can be divided into two parts: technical skills and non-technical skills.

### Technical Skills

Beyond basic software engineering and data processing abilities, you should understand ML at a deeper level—beyond just buzzwords. Ideally, you should be able to explain every architectural decision you make.

### Non-Technical Skills

Non-technical skills are crucial yet often overlooked by engineers who assume that technical competence alone will speak for itself. In the context of ML, analytical thinking, communication skills, experience, and leadership are equally important. I strongly agree with Chip’s statement: "_There are complacent engineers who’ve worked for decades with less experience than an inquisitive college student._" This reminds me that expertise doesn’t just flow like water from a tap—it requires intentional effort and hands-on practice.

## Networking and Visibility

As an INTJ who is 90% introverted, I rarely network with people. However, I've realized that this can be a significant career disadvantage. Many companies prefer sourcing candidates through referrals. Online application acceptance rates vary between companies; for instance, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle are less likely to pass online applicants, while Twitter, Amazon, and Airbnb are more open. The best networking contacts are those you’ve studied or worked with.

## Building an Outstanding Portfolio

When discussing job searching and applications, resumes are usually the first thing that comes to mind. However, Chip emphasizes that a great portfolio often speaks louder than a resume. It's essential to make your work public to _build an impossible-to-ignore portfolio._ You can write in-depth technical blog posts or papers, contribute to open-source projects, participate in hackathons, take part in coding challenges, and share your learning journey. You need to be visible to be noticed.
