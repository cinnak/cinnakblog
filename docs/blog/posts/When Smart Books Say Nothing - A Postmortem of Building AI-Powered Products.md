# When Smart Books Say Nothing: A Postmortem of *Building AI-Powered Products*

*I read it so you don’t have to. Here’s why most ‘expert guides’ on AI product management fail to deliver real insight—and what that reveals about the state of tech thought leadership.*

## 🤖 Setting the Stage: Expectations vs. Reality

I picked up *Building AI-Powered Products* by Dr. Marily Nika with genuine anticipation. As an engineer working at the intersection of systems, AI, and product development, I wanted depth. I wasn’t looking for trendy acronyms or generic "best practices." I was hoping for unexpected insight—something I didn’t already know.

Instead, I got the literary equivalent of a keynote slide deck.

## 📚 The Illusion of Insight: Content That Sounds Smart But Says Nothing

Like many books in the "AI product management" genre, this one is engineered to feel credible. It checks the right boxes:
- Career archetypes: “AI Builder PM,” “AI Experience PM”
- Frameworks: RICE, OKRs, lifecycle models
- Metrics: engagement, precision, recall, AUC
- Toolkits: Notion AI, ChatPRD, Optimizely, FullStory

But none of these tools are interrogated. No model is examined in depth. No failure case is unpacked. Every insight is presented at the altitude of a panel discussion, not a war room.

It’s not that what’s written is wrong—it’s that it adds nothing to someone already inside the AI product loop.

## 🧠 Why So Many AI Books Feel Hollow

Here’s the uncomfortable truth:  
> **Books like this aren’t for people who build AI. They’re for people who want to be seen as understanding AI.**

They exist to serve:
- PMs transitioning into tech roles
- Executives looking for talking points
- Thought leaders in need of frameworks for slide decks

Because of that, their goals aren’t alignment with technical truth—they’re alignment with audience expectations.  
Which means:
- More structure, less substance  
- More buzzwords, less decision theory  
- More abstractions, less actual tension

## 🛠 I Was Hoping For Something Real

I wasn’t expecting backpropagation math or PyTorch code. But I *was* hoping for:
- Case studies where an AI product failed and *why*
- Reflections on what it takes to productize uncertainty
- Examples of messy trade-offs between explainability and speed
- Discussions about governance, bias mitigation, or model decay

Instead, I got sanitized success narratives and bullet points dressed as wisdom.

## 🔍 A Systemic Pattern: Why Tech Books Are Often Performative

This book isn't a one-off failure. It’s a symptom of a broader trend:

> **We’ve industrialized the production of smart-sounding content without requiring that it contain real insight.**

Think about the incentives:
- "Experts" need a book to validate their brand
- Publishers need accessible content for the widest market
- Readers want to feel knowledgeable without experiencing cognitive friction

So what do we get?  
Frameworks, checklists, case studies with no blood on them.  
Smart-looking templates in place of battle-scarred strategies.

## 📚 What’s Worth Reading Instead?

Look for things that:
- Are written by practitioners, not summarizers
- Explore failure as well as success
- Focus on *decisions*, not just outcomes
- Don’t try to cover everything—just one thing, deeply

In AI PM, the best materials I’ve read weren’t books. They were:
- Design docs from internal product teams
- Postmortems of failed ML deployments
- Long-form blog posts dissecting architecture trade-offs
- Annotated research papers with commentary from people who’ve implemented the work

## 🧨 Final Thought: Maybe *You* Should Be Writing the Book

If you’re building real AI systems and none of these books resonate with your experience, it might not be you who’s missing something.

> Maybe you're already ahead of the curve these books are trying to catch up to.

Because the most important ideas in AI product management today aren't printed—they're being written live, in codebases, Slack threads, whiteboard sketches, and failure logs.

That’s where the real book is being authored.

One edge-case at a time.
